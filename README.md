This respository contains scripts used in "Upper plate faults may contribute to the paleoseismic subsidence record along
the central Hikurangi subduction zone, Aotearoa New Zealand" by Delano et al., (2023) in the journal Geochemistry, 
Geophysics, Geosystems. 

The "HB_modelling" directory includes the workflow scripts for running forward and inversion models and generating 
figures. Note that a vtk mesh file with rake data is required for the subduction zone forward model (e.g., see 
Williams et al., 2012).

The "dislocation_models" directory includes additional dislocation functions used in HB_modelling. 

More workflow-specific info is included in a second README in the "HB_modelling" directory.
